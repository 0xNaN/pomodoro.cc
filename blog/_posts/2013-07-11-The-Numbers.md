---

In this post I would like to share some numbers about statistics, users, pomodori, deploys etc in the short life of [Pomodoro.cc](https://pomodoro.cc).

Pomodoro.cc started officially in October 2014.

Since then, pomodoro.cc experienced

- **38k** unique pageviews
- **12.5k** sessions
- **9.5k** unique sessions
- **3** pages/visit
- **22min** average session duration
- **34%** bounce rate

**25%** on average are returning visitors, though with the latest release in the last month this number went up to **40%**

The data aggregated during this time is also interesting:

- over **300** registered users
- over **3k** pomodori for registered users
- over **7k** pomodori for unregistered users

The codebase went through a lot too:

- over **1.5k** commits across different repos
- over **1k** continuous deploys
- in the new version, over **20k** lines added, over **15k** lines removed
- about **10** contributors to the public repos
- over **90** issues closed on Github
