Yesterday [Pomodoro.cc](https://pomodoro.cc) received a new UI,
focussing on the bare minimum elements and functionality to keep your focus.

In addition we shipped a tasklist, that we are sure is going to be **very**
interesting for statistical purposes.

Another announcement is that the statistics are currently unaivalable,
but will be back in the course of the next couple of days.
Trust us that it's going to be worth it :)
