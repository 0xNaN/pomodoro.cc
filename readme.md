# Setup

## Vagrant

Setup a `credentials.json` starting from `credentials.template.json` and fill in your information.
You'll need to create an app for github and twitter. (If you don't want to provide them, it's fine, authentication won't work, but you need at least to create this file)

Add an entry in your `/etc/hosts`:

```
192.168.11.2    pomodoro.dev
```

Execute

```
make bootstrap
vagrant up
```


### Development

- run the tests with `npm test`

- run the end-to-end tests with `make i_web_driver` (once) and `npm run e2e-test`
