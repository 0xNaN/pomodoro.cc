# Boost your productivity
##Â Manage your time more effectively

[Pomodoro.cc](http://pomodoro.cc) is an online time tracking tool to plan and review the tasks for the day.

It takes advantage of the guidelines described in the [Pomodoro-technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com) to work more effectively with frequent, mind refreshing breaks.

With the help of insightful statistics, you'll be able to better understand how much you worked on each task and how concentrated you were.

-----

# Setup


Setup a `credentials.json` starting from `credentials.template.json` and fill in your information.
You'll need to create an app for github and twitter. (If you don't want to provide them, it's fine, authentication won't work, but you need at least to create this file)

-----

Add an entry in your `/etc/hosts`:

```
192.168.11.2    pomodoro.dev
```

Execute

```
make bootstrap
vagrant up
```

-----

The vagrant box keep the following docker containers up and running:

- `pomodoro-app`: nginx container that serves the static assets and proxies requests to the api and socket-io container
- `pomodoro-api`: node container that represents the api
- `pomodoro-socket-io`: node container that runs a socket.io server
- `redis`: for the sessions shared between the two instances of `pomodoro-api`
- `mongo`: db for the `pomodoro-api` to save pomodori of registered users

To rebuild the infrastructure run (from `/pomodoro.cc` inside vagrant)

- `sh opt/docker.rm.sh`
- `sh opt/docker.build.sh`
- `sh opt/docker.run.sh`

or

- `sh opt/docker.rm.sh && sh opt/docker.build.sh && sh opt/docker.run.sh`

##### Problems with Docker and Vagrant?

Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5748)

##### [SSL certificate](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self) and credentials

Execute `unzip ssl.zip` or

generate a self signed certificate and put the generated files under the `ssl` directory with

```
openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out pomodoro.cc.pass.key 2048
openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in pomodoro.cc.pass.key -out pomodoro.cc.key
openssl req -new -key pomodoro.cc.key -out pomodoro.cc.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in pomodoro.cc.csr -signkey pomodoro.cc.key -out bundle.crt
```

#### App

From the `app` folder:

- to recompile the assets during development, run `gulp watch`

- run the tests with `npm test`

- run the end-to-end tests with `make i_web_driver` (once) and `npm run e2e-test`

#### Api

You can run the tests with: (inside vagrant)

```
docker run -it --link=pomodoro-api-db-test:pomodoro-api-db christianfei/pomodoro-api sh -c 'npm install && npm test'
```
